Hey there!

My name is Sam and I am starting to get back into coding. I took 3 CS classes during my senior year of college, loved it but was too late to the game to major or even minor in it. Since getting out of college and working for the past two years, I realized I needed to make a career change. Now, I am starting my journey to become a front-end developer :D
